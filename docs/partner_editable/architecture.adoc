image::../images/HPC_diagram.png[Architecture]

As shown in <<architecture1>>, the Quick Start sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans two Availability Zones.
* A VPC configured with public and private subnets, according to AWS best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.
* In the public subnets:
** Managed network address translation (NAT) gateways to allow outbound internet access for resources in the private subnets.
** A Windows jump box in a public subnet for access to resources in the private subnets.
* In the private subnets:
** An HPC head node to initiate HPC workloads.
** An auto scaling group of HPC worker nodes.
// Add bullet points for any additional components that are included in the deployment. Make sure that the additional components are also represented in the architecture diagram. End each bullet with a period.
* An AWS Managed Directory Service directory.
* A managed Amazon FSx file system for shared storage.
